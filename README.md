# E3 ligase and binder prediction models

This repository contains two machine learning models and is populated with already trained models which can be used for immediate prediction with test data. Some details of the models are as follows: 

1. e3liagse_prediction.py predicts candidate E3 ligases for compounds.
2. e3binder_prediction.py predicts if a compound is E3-binder or non-binder.

The required packages with version numbers are listed in requirements.txt.
